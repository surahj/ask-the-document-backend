## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Memory Usage Test**: Skipped due to psutil dependency
2. **Real External Services**: Tests use mocks, not real AI services
3. **Large File Testing**: Limited to 50MB files
4. **Concurrent Testing**: Limited to 5 concurrent users

### Technical Debt

1. **Mock Complexity**: Some mocks are overly simplified
2. **Test Data**: Could be more diverse and realistic
3. **Performance Tests**: Could be more comprehensive
4. **Error Scenarios**: Could cover more edge cases
